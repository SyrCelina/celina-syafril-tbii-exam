# Celina Syafril Tech Basics II Exam Project

This repository contains the code for my MVP, a file for all images used in the MVP, my report as well as screenshots of the design choices and of course the README.


As internet communication and social media have become the norm, internet memes have become a cultural phenomenon that knows no bounds. 
My MVP aims to encapsulate the feeling of nostalgia and older memes by offering the user a digital capsule experience. 
The user is able to view memes from different years, select them into a capsule, save and lock the capsule for future digital digging. My project was born from the idea of a fun MVP that honors the new age rather than a sustainable one.

## Here is how to execute the MVP
1. Clone my repository in a location of your choice (in your terminal)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/syrcelina/celina-syafril-tbii-exam.git
 ```
2. Change the directory:
```sh 
cd celina-syafril-tbii-exam
 ```
3. Run the code

Mac:
```sh
python3 app.py
 ```
Windows:
```sh
python app.py
 ```
## If this does not work:

1. Download Pycharm
   
2. Open your terminal and locate your tech basics 2 folder from your command line
   
3. Create a new directory called Rewindproto in the folder
    
4. Change the directory to your Soteriaproto folder and doublecheck by using cd/pwd
   
5. Within that folder create another folder titled Images and add the images from the folder, do NOT rename them

6. Now within the Rewindproto folder create and activate a virtual environment called Rewindenv

Create your environment by typing in 

mac
```sh
virtualenv -p python Rewindenv
 ```
windows
```sh
python -m venv Rewindenv
 ```

Activate by typing in 
mac
```sh
source SOTERIA/bin/activate
 ```
windows
```sh
 \SOTERIA\scripts\activate 
 ```

7. Now check the list of packages in the new environment by typing in pip freeze
   
8. The ones that need to be installed in the SOTERIA environment are tkinter and pillow, therefore install by typing in pip3 install tk pillow
   
9. Next, open up your Pycharm and open up a new project/folder: Tech Basics 2(the general folder in which we have everything stored)
    
10. Create a Python file under the Rewindproto folder and rename it app.py
    
11. Copy the code from app.py from this repository into the new file and run it
     
12. Either through the play button at the top of the screen or by typing in python app.py into the terminal at the left of the screen.

Tip for when running the GUI: while the second GUI window can only be accessed through the Homepage button the only Username logins that work are “celina” and “sarah”.
