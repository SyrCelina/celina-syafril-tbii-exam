# Celina Syafril Tech Basics II Exam Project

This repository contains the code for my MVP, a file for all images used in the MVP, my report as well as screenshots of the design choices and of course the README.
As internet communication and social media has become norm, internet memes have become a cultural phenonemon that knows no bounds. My MVp aims to encapsulate the feeling of nostalgia and older memes by offering the user a digital capsule experience. The user is able to view memes from different years, select them into a capsule, save and lock the capsule for future digital digging. My project was born from the idea of a fun MVP that honors the new age rather than a sustainable one.

## Her is how to execute the MVP
